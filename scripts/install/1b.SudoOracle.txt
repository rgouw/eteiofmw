Sudo grants to  oracle-user 
To be able to run the script above (since it uses rpm via sudo)  we need to adapt the sudo-ers file.

Log on as root via the command:
[oracle@darlin-vce- db ~]$ su -
 
Password:
 
Last login: Fri Feb 26 06:44:05 EST 2016 on pts/0

Edit de sudoers file: 
[root@darlin-vce- db ~]# vi /etc/sudoers

Uncomment the lines for the Cmnd_Alias-es SOFTWARE en SERVICES (remove the hash ’#’ at the beginning of the line): 

## Installation and management of software
 
Cmnd_Alias SOFTWARE = /bin/rpm, /usr/bin/up2date, /usr/bin/yum
 
## Services
 
Cmnd_Alias SERVICES = /sbin/service, /sbin/chkconfig

And add the follwing two lines at the end of the file: 

## Extra rights for oracle to do for instance rpm without password.
 
oracle ALL= NOPASSWD: SERVICES, SOFTWARE

Save the file (use an exclamation mark in the ‘:wq!’ command, since sudoers is readonly.After this you can run the installJava.sh.
